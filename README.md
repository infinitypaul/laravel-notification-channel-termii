## Installation

You can install the package faster than you can say "composer" via composer:

``` bash
composer require infinitypaul/laravel-notification-channel-termii
```
Service providers... You gotta love them. You either have to install them yourself, or if you're living on the edge with Laravel 5.5 or higher, let the package auto discovery do the work for you:

```php
// config/app.php
'providers' => [
    ...
    Infinitypaul\Termii\TermiiServiceProvider::class,
],

```
### Setting up your Termii account

Time to tell Laravel your deepest secret (aka your Termii API Key). Also, add your favorite channel and an optional Sender ID. Whisper these to your config/services.php:


```php
// config/services.php
'termii' => [
'api_key' => env('TERMII_API_KEY'),
'from' => env('TERMII_FROM'),
'channel' => 'dnd' //because I know you love 'do not disturb' mode ðŸ˜‰
]
```

## Usage

The next step is as easy as pie. Simply use the channel in your via() method inside the notification:

```php
use Infinitypaul\Termii\TermiiChannel;
use Infinitypaul\Termii\TermiiMessage;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notification;

class WelcomeSMS extends Notification
{
public function via($notifiable)
{
return [TermiiChannel::class]; // see? pie!
}

    public function toTermii($notifiable)
    {
        return (new TermiiMessage())
            ->content("Thanks For Subscribing to infinitypaul.medium.com. We promise to only send interesting stuff, no cat videos... well, maybe just one.");
    }
}
```

Let's tell your Notification where it's heading(which phone are you sending to). Add the routeNotificationForTermii method to your Notifiable model (e.g., your User Model).


```php
public function routeNotificationForTermii()
{
    return $this->phone; // where `phone` is a field in your users table;
}

```
